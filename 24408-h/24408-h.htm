<h3>STRAY THOUGHTS ON PLAY-WRITING.</h3>

<p><i>From the Common-place Book of The O'Wilde.</i>&mdash;The play? Oh,
the play be zephyr'd! The play is not the thing. In other words,
the play is nothing. Point is to prepare immense assortment of
entirely irrelevant epigrams. "Epigram, my dear Duke, is the
refuge of the dullard, who imagines that he obtains truth by inverting
a truism." That sounds well; must lay it by for use. Take
"Virtue," for instance. "Virtue" offers a fine field for paradox,
brought strictly up to date. Must jot down stray thoughts. (Good idea
in the expression "Stray Thoughts." Will think over it, and work it
up either for impromptu or future play.) Here are a few examples:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(1) Be virtuous, and you will be a County Councillor.</li>

<li>(2) Nothing is so dull as a life of virtue&mdash;except a career of vice.</li>

<li>(3) "Virtue, my dear Lady <span class="sc">Chillingham</span>, is the weakness of the
masses, acting under the force of their circumstances."</li>

<li>(4) Virtue, no doubt, is a necessity; but, to be necessary, is the
first step to abolition.</li>

<li>(5) If you wish to become virtuous, you have only to be
found out.</li>

<li>(6) There is nothing a man resents so much as the imputation
of virtue.</li>

<li>(7) Virtue, my dear <span class="sc">Horace</span>, is a quality we inculcate upon our
wives mainly by a lack of example.</li>

<li>(8) I want to be rich merely in order to have the chance of overcoming
the difficulties in the way of being virtuous. Virtue on a
pound a week is so easy as to repel all but the indolent and worthless.</li></ul>

<p>So much for Virtue. Repentance may be treated according to the
same formula.</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(1) My dear boy, never repent. Repentance leads inevitably to
repetition.</li>

<li>(2) Repentance is like a secret. If you keep it to yourself it
loses all interest. Nobody can repent on a desert island.</li>

<li>(3) To repent is to have been unsuccessful.</li>

<li>(4) Not to be repentant is never to have enjoyed.</li>

<li>(5) Repentance in a man means nothing more than an intention to
change his methods; in a woman it is a last tribute to an expiring
reputation.</li></ul>

<p>Having finished these examples, I will put down a few notions for
general use.</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>(1) Necessity knows no law, and therefore has to learn.</li>

<li>(2) Everything comes to the man who is waited upon.</li>

<li>(3) The later the bird the better for the worm.</li>

<li>(4) It is never too late to&mdash;dine.</li></ul>

<p>There you have the whole secret. Be fearfully cynical, dreadfully
bold, delightfully wicked, and carefully unconventional; let paradox
and epigram flow in copious streams from your pen. Throw in a
few aristocrats with a plentiful flavouring of vices novelistically
associated with wicked Baronets. Add an occasional smoking-room&mdash;(<i>Mem.</i>
 "Everything ends in smoke, my dear boy, except the cigars
of our host." Use this when host is a <i>parvenu</i> unacquainted with
the mysteries of brands)&mdash;shred into the mixture a wronged woman,
a dull wife, and, if possible, one well tried and tested "situation,"
then set the whole to simmer for three hours at the Haymarket.
The result will be&mdash;&mdash; But to predict a result is to prophesy, and to
prophesy is to know. (N.B.&mdash;Work up this rough material. It will
come right, and sound well when polished up.)</p>

<h3>BY GEORGE!</h3>

<p>A Correspondent of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> suggests that, as the
Scotch keep up St. Andrew's Day, and the Irish St. Patrick's, the
English should also have a national <i>f&ecirc;te</i> on St. George's Day, the
23rd of April. Why not have the 23rd as St. George's Day, and the
24th as the Dragon's Day? We ought to "Remember the Dragon"&mdash;say,
by depositing wreaths before the Temple Bar specimen.
A Dragon's Day would be a most useful National Institution. The
object would not be to exalt the beast, but to celebrate our own
(and <span class="sc">George's</span>) triumph over it. Everybody has his own private
Dragon, and some people have public ones as well. For example,
Sir <span class="sc">Wilfred Lawson</span>, in laying down his wreath, would be commemorating
the introduction of the Veto Bill; Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span>
would be slaying (in spirit) the Leader of the Opposition in the
House of Lords, who is evidently the "Dragon of the Prime
(Minister)" referred to by <span class="sc">Tennyson</span>; Lord <span class="sc">Cranborne</span> would be
Mr. <span class="sc">Davitt's</span> Dragon, and so on. The fun would be that nobody
would be expected to say <i>what</i> Dragon he meant. If a law were
passed establishing such a festivity, perhaps it would be denounced
as "too Dragonic"!</p>

<p>Poet <span class="sc">William Watson's</span> <i>Excursions in Criticism</i> are cheap
Excursions. He himself describes them as "Prose Recreations of a
Rhymer." "Prosy" would have been the truer epithet. The
meeting of an Interviewer with Dr.
<span class="sc">Johnson</span> is the best, and it is also the
last. Poet <span class="sc">Watson's</span> criticism of <i>Tess of
the D'Urbevilles</i>, his Essay on <span class="sc">Ibsen's</span>
Plays, and another on <span class="sc">George Meredith</span>,
may have been recreations to the
writer, but, like most of the other papers
in this volume, they will never be so
considered by the lightheaded and unbiassed
reader. What is recreation to
<span class="sc">William Watson</span> is boredom to the
Baron, and, as the latter is inclined to
think, to the majority of such of the
public as may attempt the perusal of
W. W.'s recreations. Let W. W. make
no more cheap excursions in criticism,&mdash;excepting,
of course, for his own
private amusement, with which no one
has a right to interfere,&mdash;but let him "thank the gods he is
poetical," and so let him remain. His second best Essay, is on
<i>The Punishment of Genius</i>, in which he advocates the post-mortem
destruction of every scrap of composition, which its author had
never intended for the public eye.</p>

<h2>CREDIT WITHOUT CASH.</h2>

<p>The Hon. <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus Cash</span>
was greatly annoyed that
so many people should have
been admitted to his library.
He bitterly reproached his
valet for this dereliction of
duty.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, Sir,"
said his servant, "but they
<i>would</i> come in. They said
they must see you&mdash;that
their lives depended on
it."</p>

<p>"What have I to do
with their lives?" growled
the Hon. <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus</span>. And
then he added, as he entered
his sanctum, "Now,
Ladies and Gentlemen,
what do you want? My
time's precious, and I can't
waste it upon strangers."</p>

<p>"My dear Sir, my very
dear Sir," cried in trembling
accents an old parson
in a thread-bare coat, "I
have a wife and family,
and we are really starving."</p>

<p>"Ditto, Sir, ditto!" observed
an elderly soldier
who had evidently been an
officer.</p>

<p>"And I am a widow,
and must bring my poor
children home from school,
as I can no longer afford
the expense of their education,"
so said an elderly dame in shabby
mourning.</p>

<p>"But how can I help you?" asked the
Hon. <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus</span>. "What has brought you to
this pass?"</p>

<p>"Why, you, Sir," returned the ex-officer.
"You, Sir!"</p>

<p>"Come," said the Hon. <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus</span>, waxing
angry, "I advise you to be careful of the
provisions of the Libel and Slander Act. You
accuse me of bringing you to poverty! Why,
I have never seen any of you in my life&mdash;never
even heard of you!"</p>

<p>"But we have heard of you," they cried.
"Yes, we have."</p>

<p>"We are all shareholders in the Bubble
Babble Syndicate, Limited," explained the
parson, tearfully, "and we have consequently
lost every thing we had in the world."</p>

<p>"But what have I to do with it?" again
asked the Hon. <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus</span>. "Very sorry to hear
of your misfortunes, but I don't see how <i>I</i>
come in."</p>

<p>"Why you, Sir," exclaimed the ex-officer;
"you, Sir, were one of the officials!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir, I was nothing of the
sort. I have nothing whatever to do
with the Syndicate. I was merely a
Director."</p>

<p>And when the defrauded shareholders found
out that he was only <i>that</i>, they went away
complaining, but convinced they would be
afforded by him no relief. And they were
right, for the Hon. <span class="sc">Cr&oelig;sus</span> (who was old-fashioned
in his ways) acted strictly according
to precedent.</p>

<h3>TOO BAD TO BE TRUE.</h3>

<p>At a meeting of the
London Diocesan Conference,
a Reverend
gentleman is reported
to have declared his
belief that, "for one
man drawn from the
Public-house by the
opening of the Museums
on Sunday,
there were ten persons
drawn from their attendance
at Church!"
<i>Mr. Punch</i> fancies
these are rather supposititious
statistics.
Does the Reverend
gentleman quite see
what his hasty statement
involves? How
slight must be the
attractions of Church&mdash;<i>his</i>
Church at least&mdash;to
a large proportion
even of those who <i>do</i>
now attend? Rivalry
between Museum and
Gin-palace one can
contemplate hopefully.
But if the real
rivalry is to be between
Museum and Church,
with such results as
this rather pessimistic
parson predicts, the
look-out seems rather
dismal&mdash;for the
Church! Surely this
is the highest compliment
to secular attractions
ever paid by a
cleric! <i>Mr. Punch</i>
hopes&mdash;and believes&mdash;it
is as ill-deserved
as high.</p>

<h3>"ECCLESIASTICAL INTELLIGENCE."</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;"><br /><a href="images/197a.png"><img src="images/197a-250.png" width="250" height="255" alt="ECCLESIASTICAL INTELLIGENCE." /></a></div>

<p>Under this heading the <i>Times</i>, some days ago, informed us that a
certain set of Oxford Dons had met together in order to make
arrangements for the establishment in the University of a couple
of first-class Evangelical Clergymen, possessing "special gifts,"
to whom such Undergraduates as might be piously inclined could
go for instruction and good
counsel. It was stated, in their
sketch of a prospectus of this
scheme, that these two grave
and reverend Gentlemen are to
be "accessible at all times."
This is excellent. Also, "they
will be given to hospitality,"
which is still more excellent,
and let us hope that, in return,
hospitality will be given to <i>them</i>.
But it is difficult to combine
"accessibility at all times" with
perpetual festivities. For how
would it suit either of these
well-intentioned Clergymen,
after the hospitalities of an
ordinary day, commencing with University Breakfast, going on to
University Lunch, thence to University Tea, then dinner, wine, and,
finally, supper, to be accessible to anyone who chose to ring them up
during the small hours to ask for "counsel and advice so judicious
and so sound"? Very "special" indeed would have to be the
"gifts" of the two always-hospitable and ever-accessible Clergymen,
who would undertake the mission; and, among their most
essential special qualifications, would have to be, first, the capacity
for taking any amount of everything without being in the least the
worse for it, and, secondly, the capacity of perpetual wakefulness and
clear-headedness, without the extraneous and artificial application
of wet towels round the head. Men with such special gifts are,
indeed, rare; nay, they are demi-gods. But, if such men are to be
found, no matter at what cost, we sincerely wish they (the originators
of this scheme) may get them.</p>

<h2>MIXED NOTIONS.</h2>

<h3>No. IX.&mdash;PARISH COUNCILS.</h3>

<h4>(<i>Scene and Persons as usual.</i>)</h4>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>to himself, as he reads his paper</i>). Well, I'm dashed!
What the blue blazes does all this stuff mean?</p>

<p><i>First Well-informed Man</i> (<i>to</i> Second W. I. M., <i>in a tone of
pitying good-humour, mixed with conscious superiority</i>). He's got
started on his usual morning puzzle.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>with asperity</i>). Oh, it's all very well for you two chaps
to sneer. You're both older than I am, and, as you've been about
more, you ought to know more. Anyhow, I like to find out about
things, and, when I don't know, I ask those who do.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>not unkindly</i>). Well, well, never mind all that.
You know I don't mind telling you anything. I really didn't mean
to sneer. What's your difficulty?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> It's all about this Parish Councils Bill.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What about it?</p>

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>hopelessly</i>). What does it mean? What <i>is</i> a Parish
Councils Bill?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Oh, well, you know, a Parish Councils Bill is&mdash;&mdash;well,
it's a Bill for giving Parish Councils.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Yes&mdash;but whom are they going to give them to?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Why, to the Parishes, of course.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> Ah! (<i>Continues reading. A puzzled frown settles on
his face.</i>) But why can't the Parishes make their own Councils,
without all this fuss in Parliament? Couldn't every Parish
simply say, "I'm going to have a Council," and just start it straight
away?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> My dear fellow, you know nothing can be done
without an Act of Parliament.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But they call this a Bill, not an Act.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> It's only another way of saying the same thing.
A Bill or an Act&mdash;it's all one.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> No, it isn't.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I'll lay you a couter it is.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Done!</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Well, what do <i>you</i> (<i>withering emphasis</i>) say
is
the difference?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> When the House of Commons brings anything
in, it's a Bill, and when the House of Lords does it, it's an Act.
Pay up!</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Not I. That's precisely what I meant, only you
wouldn't give me time to say it. Why, that's the A B C of politics.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Seems to take a lot of learning, anyway.</p>

<p style="float: right; margin-top: -1em;">[<i>A pause.</i></p><br />

<p><i>Inquirer</i> (<i>returning to his point</i>). But look here. What have they
brought the Parish Councils Bill in for? I thought we'd all got
County Councils all over the place.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>slapping him warmly on the back</i>). My dear chap,
you've just hit the nail plumb on the right head. That's what
I've said all along. The whole country's being simply ruined with
all these blessed Councils. Every man will have to be his own
Council before long, if they go on making Councils at this rate.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Well, anyhow, your beautiful Conservative
Government, that you were so dashed proud of, started the business.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). I deny it.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Deny away. Perhaps you'll tell me that Lord
<span class="sc">Beaconsfield</span> didn't set the County Councils going?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> Ah, but those were quite different County
Councils. Why, they weren't even called Councils; they were
called Boards.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> They may <i>have</i> been called Boards, but they're
called Councils now, and that's enough for me. Anyhow, don't
you see (<i>furtively consults newspaper and quotes</i>) that "Parish
Councils are the logical and necessary development of the scheme of
County Government left imperfect by the Conservatives"?</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> No. I don't see it at all.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Well, then, how do you propose to root the
agricultural population in the soil? You must admit&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> I don't admit anything&mdash;at least, I won't until
you tell me how a Parish Council is going to root anybody, let alone
an agricultural labourer, in anything. There's too much mollycoddling
of these agricultural labourers, that's what I say.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> (<i>doggedly</i>). You're always talking about
agricultural depression and hard times for those that live on the
land, and you won't lift a finger to help them when you get the
chance. If we give these chaps Parish Councils, they can all get
allotments, and then of course (<i>quotes again</i>) "we shall multiply the
productive power of the land tenfold."</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> What have allotments got to do with Parish
Councils?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> Everything.</p>

<p><i>First W. I. M.</i> (<i>triumphant</i>). Then how do you account for my
Uncle's coachman having an allotment at this very moment?
He's had it for years, long before anybody even heard of Parish
Councils.</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> That exactly proves my point. It's just
because he <i>isn't</i> an agricultural labourer that he's been able to get
it. What we want to do is to level up.</p>

<p><i>Inquirer.</i> But there aren't any agricultural labourers in my parish;
at least, I never heard of any. How are they going to manage about
that?</p>

<p><i>Second W. I. M.</i> They'll send you some from somewhere else.
That's what they call migration.</p>
<p style="float: right">[<i>Terminus.</i></p>
<p><i>Inquirer.</i> I thought birds did that.</p>

a step before Monday. So you will tell me all
about the Royal Academy Private View, now won't
you?</p>

<p><i>Miss Bee.</i> Of course I will do my best; but you
know my forte is not description. What do you
want to know?</p>

<p><i>Lady Hay.</i> Why, of course, who were there, and
what they said, and (most important of all) what
they wore. I hope, dear, you will notice if they
are wearing any of the new-fashioned bonnets, and
if hats are going out.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bee.</i> You may rely upon me, darling.</p>

<p><i>Lady Hay.</i> And mind you get at the last bit of
scandal. There ought to be plenty about, now that
people have come back from the Riviera. But, my dear, you know
exactly what I should like, so it is useless to prompt you. I leave
everything to your discretion.</p>

<p><i>Miss Bee.</i> Quite so, darling. (<i>After a pause.</i>) I thought I had

<h4>FALBULOUS!</h4>

<p><span class="sc">Dr. Falb</span>, of Vienna, knows when earthquakes and eruptions are
going to occur. Mr. <span class="sc">Morley</span> said, the other day, in the House of
Commons, that the best way of treating a prophet was not to believe
him; but this is rather difficult when the prophet happens to be
right, as Dr. <span class="sc">Falb</span> generally is. For example, he predicted the last
terrible earthquake at Zante, which only came one day before it was
due. Dr. <span class="sc">Falb</span> has been interviewed about how he does it,&mdash;or
perhaps it would be more appropriate to say, that he has been subjected
to some mild "Heckling"&mdash;and he appears to hold that it is
the action of the Moon on the tides which is responsible. In
support of his theory it has been noticed that it is quite a custom of
the people at Zante, after their houses have fallen in on their heads,
to observe&mdash;"That was a tidy shock!" These predictions should
help them to tide over the periods of danger.</p>

<h4>COURT OUT!</h4>

<p>What is an "Original Farcical Romance"? The immediate reply is
that <i>The Amazons</i>, by Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span>, is a specimen of the genus. To
see <i>The Amazons</i> ought to supply the terms of the required definition.
I have seen it, and yet the definition does not satisfy me.
"<i>Original</i>"<i>!</i> Well&mdash;more or less; but to use old materials in a novel
manner is quite enough for originality. The girl brought up as a
boy is not absolutely new or original, <i>vide</i> <i>Tom Noddy's Secret</i>,
and
multiply the heroine of that farce by three. The three men hunting
after the three girls and obtaining access to them at school&mdash;substituting,
in this case, home for school, and a mother for a school-mistress&mdash;is
not absolutely new or original; but, again, what matters
this to anyone, so long as the new shape given to the old material is
genuinely amusing? So "farcical" goes with "original." But
now, as to its being a "Romance?" Would not the term "burlesque"
be a better term than "Farcical Romance?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/201a.png"><img src="images/201a-300.png" width="300" height="379" alt="One of the Points of the Piece. The Queen of the Amazons gets the Needle." /></a><br /><br />
<p class="center">One of the Points of the Piece. The Queen of the Amazons
gets the Needle.</p>
</div>
<p>
The characters
of the three adventurous lovers are not less burlesque than were
those of the three Knights in <span class="sc">Albert Smith's</span> romantic Extravaganza,
<i>The Alhambra</i>, played then by <span class="sc">Alfred Wigan</span>, and Mr.
and Mrs. <span class="sc">Keeley</span>. So if I may take it that "Farcical Romance"
is only a way out of describing the piece as "burlesque," then I
know how to class it, and what to expect. Now I must own
that my puzzlement is due to my own fault, for it so chanced
that I did not look at the author's description of his play until
after leaving the theatre. I thought I was seeing something
that was intended to be as broad a farce as <i>B&eacute;b&eacute;, alias Betsy</i>,
but I soon found that, whatever it might be, it wasn't this. It is
capitally acted by all, but especially, on "the Spear Side," by Mr.
<span class="sc">Weedon Grossmith</span> and F. <span class="sc">Kerr</span>, the former as an effeminate
Earl,
and the latter as a manly Viscount.
But, even from a burlesque point of
view, Mr. <span class="sc">Elliot</span> overdoes the Frenchman,
a part which belongs to a stage-family
of Frenchmen, of which, in
former times, <span class="sc">Alfred Wigan</span> was
the best representative; and, later,
Mons. <span class="sc">Marius</span>, who, as the French
sporting nobleman, in <i>Family Ties</i>,
in love with an English "Mees," and
so proud of his English slang, was
simply the character to the life,
without any more exaggeration than
was artistically necessary. On "the
Spindle Side," Miss <span class="sc">Lily Hanbury</span>
looks handsome, and is generally
fairly well-suited; Miss <span class="sc">Pattie
Browne</span> has the most difficult part
of the three, and it is not to be wondered
at if she a bit out-tommies

looks, acts, and sings charmingly as

<p>The places where the fun comes in,

the more precious, are chiefly
with <span class="sc">Weedon Grossmith</span>, and in the
scenes between Mr. F. <span class="sc">Kerr</span> and

up to the former "screamers," such

Mr. <span class="sc">Weedon Grossmith</span> played the part of Mrs. <span class="sc">John Wood's</span>
solicitor. The scenery by Mr. <span class="sc">Hall</span> is Hall good, specially the
woodland scene in Overcote Park.

<p>"<span class="sc">Much Ado About <i>Nil</i></span>."&mdash;Were the Temporal Power in existence,
the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span>, in proposing the toast of the <span class="sc">Pope</span> before
that of the <span class="sc">Queen</span>, would have been guilty of a blunder, and we all
know, on <span class="sc">Talleyrand's</span> authority, how far worse is a blunder than
a crime. But the <span class="sc">Pope</span>, being no longer "two single gentlemen
rolled into one," but simply, as it might be set down in a Play-bill
of <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i>, "First Bishop," and also by his own style
and title, "<i>Servus Servorum</i>," the health of His Holiness (which is
uncommonly good) might, in British Dominions, be introduced
after that of the <span class="sc">Queen</span> and Royal Family, and could be fitted into
Church and State as neatly as possible, that is, where such a toast
is a necessity of the entertainment. But the stupidity of the
incident has been surpassed by the idiocy of the notice taken of it,
and, for the sake of the common sense of the Common Council, it is
to be hoped that a large majority will be on the side of Alderman
and Sheriff <span class="sc">Renals</span>, and refuse to toast the <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> on the
Gridiron of <span class="sc">Lawrence</span>.</p>

<h4>TAKEN IN, BUT NOT DONE FOR.</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Overflow Letters, probably
originally intended for a
Contemporary.</i>)</p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;No doubt you have
seen in the papers recently
a number of letters, giving
accounts of the stoppage
of cabs by well-dressed
young men, who, after
heartily greeting the occupants,
have asked for the
loan of a sovereign. The
other day something of the
same sort occurred to me.
I got into an omnibus,
when a man, purporting to
be a Conductor, asked me
for my fare. I replied
that I would pay him later
on. He then proceeded to
mount to the roof, apparently
to collect other
money, when I quickly
descended. I firmly believe
that, had I not acted
promptly, I should have
been defrauded of three-pence.
Believe me, yours,
&amp;c.,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">Vigilant</span>.</p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;I think you should
know the last dodge. I
was walking home from a
rather heavy dinner the
other evening, when I
came across a man exactly
like myself. He might
have been my twin brother.
He didn't say anything,
but put out his hand towards
me as if asking for
alms. Of course I refused,
as I could see that the man
was drunk. A little later
I was escorted home by a
policeman. The next
morning, when I got to the
spot where I had been
accosted by this silently-begging
stranger, I found
a looking-glass. The police
say they have the matter
in hand, but they do not see
much prospect of finding
the original.</p>
<p class="author">&mdash;T. <span class="sc">O'Baccus</span>.</p>

<p>SIR,&mdash;As a warning to
the less wary, I beg to
send you the following
particulars:&mdash;A short time
ago I met at a Charity
Banquet an Alderman who
was apparently a most excellent
gentleman; and I
lay a stress upon this fact
to show how deceptive are
appearances. After the
speeches, my City friend
said he would like to subscribe
to the benefaction.
He asked me if I had
change for a five-pound
note. I replied I had only
four pounds. He said that
that would do, and that I
could forward him the
additional sovereign at my
leisure. I then handed
over the quartette of golden
coins in exchange for his
bank-note. Immediately
afterwards I quitted the
apartment to ascertain if
the note was genuine. I
have not seen the Alderman
since. I may add that
although I believe the
draft a forgery, I have received
its full alleged value
from the Bank of England.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 11.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Lord Mayor of Dublin</span>
dropped in to pass time of day with <span class="sc">Speaker</span>. Accompanied by a
score of his merry Councilmen, arrayed in scarlet cloaks trimmed
with costly furs. Made ordinary Members in black coats feel very
small. T. D. <span class="sc">Sullivan</span>, the Bard of Erin, long known at Westminster,
is also Member of Dublin Corporation. Brought over his
scarlet robes; took his seat within the Bar; other Members of
Corporation, of course, kept outside sacred precincts. Some little disturbance
at door when <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> arrived in procession, preceded by
Mace, and accompanied by Sword-Bearer. These wanted to enter
House, and support his Lordship as he stood at Bar in alien assembly.</p>

<p>"You enter only across my body," said the Serjeant-at-Arms,
lightly, but firmly, touching the hilt of his terrible brand.</p>

<p>A moment's awful pause. The sword brought over from Ireland
would, in weight and cubic capacity, have made ten of the rapier
to which <span class="sc">Erskine</span> of Cardross had significantly called attention.
When, later, it peacefully rested behind doorkeeper's chair, its mighty
hilt rose above topmost height like the cross on a cathedral spire.
Sword-Bearer looked at <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span>; Mace-Bearer grasped with both
hands shaft of his ponderous weapon. Both warriors accustomed to
public meetings in Dublin; knew what was expected of them by way
of argument. <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span> happily in placable mood. Readjusting
around his neck the collar of gold (the very one "<span class="sc">Malachi</span> won from
the proud Invader"), he bowed his head; Mace and Sword were
deposited behind doorkeeper's chair, and his Lordship strode in,
escorted by the crimson-gowned, fur-betrimmed City Fathers.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span>, supported on either side by a stately Alderman,
stood at Bar holding what at first sight looked like a shillelagh.</p>

<p>"What have you there, my <span class="sc">Lord Mayor of Dublin</span>?" asked
the <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, in tones so stern they made the sword rattle in the
scabbard on the other side of the closed door.</p>

<p>Nothing escapes <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> Eye when he pleases to bring it to bear
on a particular focus. Had seen the implement in <span class="sc">Lord Mayor's</span>
hand; insisted upon knowing all about it before proceedings went
further. Turned out to be nothing more dangerous than petition
from Corporation of Dublin in favour of Home-Rule Bill. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>,
instantly mollified, allowed it to be read; after which <span class="sc">Lord Mayor</span>,
bowing, retired; Mace and Sword found all right, and possession
resumed. As the thin red streak filed out of doorway, T. D. S. still
lingering in seat by Cross Benches, said, as he looked admiringly
upon the befurred crimson robes. "Reminds me, <span class="sc">Toby</span>, of a line
from <span class="sc">Goldsmith</span>. You remember it in <i>The Deserted Village?</i></p>

<p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Eighth Night Debate on Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Found <span class="sc">Vicary Gibbs</span> (well-known firm, <span class="sc">Sons And
Antony Gibbs</span>, of the City and the Universe) rather in dumps
to-night. Been a burglar at family mansion in Regent's Park; the
Firm at dinner; <span class="sc">Sons</span> standing a little meal for <span class="sc">Antony</span>;
burglar
took opportunity of entering by bedroom window, first observing precaution
of screwing up doors, and other entrances and exits, so that
he might pursue his vocation with that certainty of non-disturbance
upon which all well-bred burglars insist. Loot considerable,
Providence blessing the burglar with tea-pots and spoons to extent
that would have excited envy in heart of <span class="sc">Hans Breitmann</span>.</p>

<p>"Well, cheer up," I said to young <span class="sc">Vicary</span>; "awkward, of
course, to lose this property; some of it, probably, heirlooms; at
least, there was no bloodshed. You should be thankful for that."</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span>

<p>"Not at all," said <span class="sc">Vicary</span>, the light of Ulster battle ditches flaming
in his eyes. "I should like to have shed some myself. But it isn't
that, nor is it the material jewels whose disappearance I lament.
They are things that are bought and sold; they may be replaced.
Fact is, old friend" (hate to see a strong young man sobbing),
"there was more than that."</p>

<p>"I didn't see anything else mentioned in the papers," I remarked.</p>

<p>"No; we resolved to bear our burden among ourselves. I don't
mind telling you, that beside the brooches, bracelets, chains, rings,
and other things of that sort, the fellows stole the notes I had made
for speech on Home-Rule Bill. Been here night after night since
debate opened, sitting patiently waiting to catch <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> eye.
Have given up my dinner and other evening delights; night after
night <span class="sc">Speaker</span> has passed me over. I waited on; everything has
its compensation; the enforced delay proved invaluable, as supplying
opportunity for improving original draft of speech. As I sat
and listened, great thoughts surged through my mind; happy illustrations
flashed upon me; irresistible arguments were slowly
moulded. Jotted 'em all down. Notes getting, perhaps, a little
long; couldn't have managed to work them off in less than two
hours; but House would, I know, have suffered gladly for that
time, or even longer. An audience
that has survived two
hours of <span class="sc">Asmead Bartlett</span>
(Knight) is not disposed to
mince matters. Last night
resolved to get it over: told
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> to tell <span class="sc">Akers-Douglas</span>
to arrange with
<span class="sc">Speaker</span> to call me as near
ten o'clock as possible. Went
home for slight repast; placed
notes of speech on dressing-table;
thought with passing
pleasure of the policeman we
have kept these thirty years
perambulating St. Dunstan's
in view of possible burglar,
and went to dinner. When I
tripped upstairs, meaning to
go down to House, found notes
gone, and, incidentally, &pound;2000
worth of jewellery. I won't
disguise from you, <span class="sc">Toby</span> old
man, my private conviction that the whole thing was a plant. Mr.
<span class="sc">Gladstone's</span> <i>at the bottom of it!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Ninth Night Debate on Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Sexton</span> made five speeches to-night, each sufficient
of itself to lay foundation of parliamentary reputation. Had he
spread them over the Session, or even distributed them throughout a
month, would have scored great success. Unhappily worked them
all off at single sitting, without other interval than succession of
long pauses, arbitrarily introduced. Fancy he felt he must do something
to maintain ancient reputation. <span class="sc">Grandolph</span> and <span class="sc">John
Morley</span> spoke for two hours each, whilst few, having caught
<span class="sc">Speaker's</span> eye, let go under ninety minutes. <span class="sc">Sexton</span> must needs
beat record; did it, talking for two hours and half by Westminster
clock! Had an hour and a half served, speech would have been
worthy to rank with those of <span class="sc">Asquith</span>, <span class="sc">John Redmond</span>, and
<span class="sc">Davitt</span>.
As it is, case one of oratorial suicide. <span class="sc">Carson</span> followed; quite
moderate
in comparison. Spoke for little over an hour. When he sat
down, it was after eight o'clock; more that one-half of possible length
of sitting exhausted; only two Members taken part in Debate.</p>

<p>"Debate d'ye call it," said <span class="sc">Lord Morris</span>, looking on from the
Peer's Gallery. "It's preaching rather&mdash;pragmatical prosing, the
death of useful Parliamentary discussion."</p>

<p>House left in almost comatose state. Someone faintly moved Count;
<span class="sc">Marjoriebanks</span>, who had not suffered the four hours' talk, and who, by
comparison with rest, seemed supernaturally active, managed to bring
in what was left of forty Members, and conversation drowsily proceeded
to appointed hour of closing. <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Eleventh Night.</p>

window, something that looks remarkably like the streak of dawn,

have some dim recollection
that, in a former state, this
sort of thing went on for a
Thousand and One Nights,
ending in the most agreeable
manner to the principal personages
concerned. But that,
you will admit, was in other
circumstances. The world,
and we, were younger then.
Eleven nights of this is enough
for me, and, if you would be
so good as to step into the next
room, I will give instructions
for your being&mdash;excuse this
yawn&mdash;bowstrung."</p>

Lobby; Mr. G. down on
stroke of One o'clock: splendid
speech&mdash;a mental and physical
miracle; for little over an hour he entranced an audience still suffering
from two hours of <span class="sc">Henry James</span>, throughout which the eminent
jurist sank below lowest level hitherto known of his Parliamentary
capacity. <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> at his best; in brisk fighting mood, hitting
out right and left; stirring <span class="sc">Tim Healy's</span> soul with surging desire to
get up and reply. No opportunity so <span class="sc">Tim</span> snapped at him across Gangway,
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> cutting back with ever-smiling face. When, just
now Mr. G. walked in from Division Lobby, Liberals and Irish Members
leaped to their feet, welcoming him with waving hats, and strident
cheers. A moving scene, introducing announcement that, in House
of 651 Members, every absentee accounted for, Ministerial majority
ran up to 43. <i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Home-Rule Bill read Second Time.</p>
